# Data Ingestion ( collecting data from various sources ) & data splitting ( train, val, test)
# EDA
# Data Validiation ( date type checking, Outlier checking, Data Drift )

    #Data Srift : Supose the similar data we already had and we checked stats for that data
    #and after again getting such data, stats now are drifting from previous ONE
    #so the model performance will affect and hence we will need to enhance / optimise model again and
    #cant use the whole process yet again. i.e when stats of old dataset no longer align with new dataset

# Data Transformation / Feature Engineering
# Model Training & Hyperparam. tuning
# model evaluation and comparision

# (also to apply the set of feat engg. in test dataset, we make a pickle of steps and transfor test dataset)
